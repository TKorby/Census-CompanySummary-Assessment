# Census-CompanySummary-Assessment

You will need to create a config.py file that has a dictionary with the "key" set to "API_key_string". The "API_key_string" will require you to sign up for the census API at this address: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html. Once signed up, you will have to validate your account to access your personal "API_key_string".
